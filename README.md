## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ pnpm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## DynamoDB Local Setup

This project uses Amazon DynamoDB for data storage. For local development, you can use DynamoDB Local running in a Docker container.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine

### Running DynamoDB Local

1. Start the DynamoDB Local container:

```bash
cd nova-backend
docker-compose up -d
# or
pnpm db:local:up
```

2. Use the `.env.local` file for local development:

```bash
cp .env.local .env
```

3. DynamoDB Local will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

4. You can verify if DynamoDB Local is running:

```bash
aws dynamodb list-tables --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
```

### Running DynamoDB Local with the Application

To start both the DynamoDB Local container and your application with a single command:

```bash
# Start DynamoDB and then the app (sequential)
pnpm dev

# Start DynamoDB and the app concurrently
pnpm dev:full
```

### Running Everything with Docker Compose

You can also run both the DynamoDB Local and the NestJS application together using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start both services (app + DynamoDB)
pnpm docker:dev

# Start both services and rebuild containers
pnpm docker:dev:build
```

This will:

- Start the DynamoDB Local container
- Build and start the NestJS application container
- Connect the app to DynamoDB automatically
- Make the app available at http://localhost:3024

The docker-compose setup uses environment variables from your `.env` file, so make sure you have all the necessary variables defined there. You don't need to manually copy `.env.local` to `.env` when using Docker Compose, as all the environment variables are sourced directly from your `.env` file.

> **Important**: When running the app in Docker, make sure your `.env` file has `HOST=0.0.0.0` (not localhost). This ensures the app is accessible from outside the container.

Note: For local development, the application automatically connects to the local DynamoDB instance when `NODE_ENV=development`.
